day1: ant, done - 12/29/2014
	using eclipse default ant
day2: webservice - http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnayn.html
	after research about JAX-WS, JAX-RS, AXIS etc. glossary, I decided implement the webservice based on CXF + Tomcat + eclipse.
	tutorial: https://angelozerr.wordpress.com/2011/08/23/jaxwscxf_step1/
	1. download cxf: http://cxf.apache.org/download.html and install
	2. use eclipse CXF wizard to create web service
	3. use ant to deploy into Tomcat
		->Tomcat error: error listenerstart 
		reason: lib file
		solution: add lib dependence for war - war all CXF lib into WEB-INF/lib
		->Tomcat error: cannot find [META-INF/cxf/cxf-extension-jaxrs-binding.xml]
		reason: cxf-beans.xml include several import xml like <import resource="classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf-extension-jaxrs-binding.xml" />
		solution: remove the import from cxf-beans.xml, because "It's no longer needed. With 2.4.x, most of the META-INF/cxf files are no longer needed and can be removed. Really, the cxf.xml one is the only one needed."
		->done
	summary:
	http://localhost:8080/helloWorld shows web page
	http://localhost:8080/helloWorld/services shows web service
	http://localhost:8080/helloWorld/services/CommentDAOPort?wsdl shows the wsdl
	the key of the web service
		java class - using WebService annotation to define the web service
		web.xml - define the cxf servlet
		cxf-beans.xml - define the java bean of the web service
